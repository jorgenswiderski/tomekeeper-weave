This effect can stack.\n:* Notes:\n:** The cantrip you learn must be one of these:\n:*** Bone Chill\n:*** Eldritch Blast\n:*** Fire Bolt\n:*** Ray of Frost\n:*** Shocking Grasp\n:*** Thorn Whip\n:** These cantrips use the character's Spellcasting Ability. For example, if a Cleric chooses Eldritch Blast with this feat, they use their Wisdom modifier and not their Charisma modifier.",

This effect can stack.\n:* Notes:\n:** The cantrip you learn must be one of these:\n:*** Bone Chill\n:*** Eldritch Blast\n:*** Fire Bolt\n:*** Ray of Frost\n:*** Shocking Grasp\n:*** Thorn Whip\n:** These cantrips use the character's Spellcasting Ability. For example, if a Cleric chooses Eldritch Blast with this feat, they use their Wisdom modifier and not their Charisma modifier.",
