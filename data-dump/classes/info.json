Both Arm Thy Servant and Golden Generosity can be used outside of combat and the items they create stick around indefinitely (although, of course, the items created by Golden Generosity are consumable).\n\nThe items generated in the Bestowed Bounty are tied to each save. The first cast of Bestowed Bounty on a save will always give the same items, the second a different set, and so on. This means that save-scumming to get a better roll on the chest is not possible.\n\nThe base value of the Devotee's Mace, created by Arm Thy Servant, is 640 gold. It costs 200 gold to respec a character into a cleric, create the Devotee's Mace, and then change back (or to recruit a hireling and respec them into a cleric). You could use this as a source of cash, if you were somehow running low on funds at level 10.\n\nReturn to top",

To wit:\n** Only the caster of this spell gains Advantage on their next attack against the affected target, never their allies.\n** Only the first attack roll following the application of the condition gains Advantage. The condition is removed immediately afterward, whether the attack roll is a hit or a miss.\n** The duration is 2 turns, but this includes the turn on which the condition is applied. This is true of many spells, but is especially important for short duration spells.\n* True Strike is rarely considered worth using due to its opportunity cost; a full action must be spent on it to improve the chances of hitting once. Most of the time, if two actions are available (whether on the same turn or not), attacking twice is more effective than attacking once with advantage due to damage bonuses.\n* However, True Strike is not considered aggressive, so the caster could cast it just before combat to gain its benefits without having to spend an action mid-fight. This eliminates the opportunity cost. Note that the duration is only 2 turns (12 seconds while not in turn-based mode).\n* Another niche use case exists for an Arcane Trickster making a Sneak Attack (Melee)|Sneak Attack. If the caster is out of spell slots, and no allies can flank for a sneak attack, and there is no other way to gain advantage for an attack roll, spending a single action on True Strike to enable a single sneak attack can be considered efficient.\n** In such cases, True Strike can be even more useful when using the Sneak Attack (Ranged)|ranged version of sneak attack, since this allows the caster to benefit from the range of the cantrip, especially with a High Ground bonus. At such distances, however, it is typically easier to just use a Bonus Action to hide first and obtain Advantage.",

If the initial attack would have 3 applications then the target would be Downed|downed on 1st attack and again on 3rd attack. In case of Avatars it means that, whilst having a Death Ward applied, they would need to receive 6 attack applications to fully die: 2 to break down the ward, 1 to get downed and 3 more to fail 3 Death Saves. This effect seems to apply to all multi-application attacks, like Magic Missile and Eldritch Blast (as of 4.1.1.3669438).",

To wit:\n** Only the caster of this spell gains Advantage on their next attack against the affected target, never their allies.\n** Only the first attack roll following the application of the condition gains Advantage. The condition is removed immediately afterward, whether the attack roll is a hit or a miss.\n** The duration is 2 turns, but this includes the turn on which the condition is applied. This is true of many spells, but is especially important for short duration spells.\n* True Strike is rarely considered worth using due to its opportunity cost; a full action must be spent on it to improve the chances of hitting once. Most of the time, if two actions are available (whether on the same turn or not), attacking twice is more effective than attacking once with advantage due to damage bonuses.\n* However, True Strike is not considered aggressive, so the caster could cast it just before combat to gain its benefits without having to spend an action mid-fight. This eliminates the opportunity cost. Note that the duration is only 2 turns (12 seconds while not in turn-based mode).\n* Another niche use case exists for an Arcane Trickster making a Sneak Attack (Melee)|Sneak Attack. If the caster is out of spell slots, and no allies can flank for a sneak attack, and there is no other way to gain advantage for an attack roll, spending a single action on True Strike to enable a single sneak attack can be considered efficient.\n** In such cases, True Strike can be even more useful when using the Sneak Attack (Ranged)|ranged version of sneak attack, since this allows the caster to benefit from the range of the cantrip, especially with a High Ground bonus. At such distances, however, it is typically easier to just use a Bonus Action to hide first and obtain Advantage.",
